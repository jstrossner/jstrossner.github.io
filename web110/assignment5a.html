    <p>5A, Activity One: Social Networking

In this activity, I read about Social Networking and different types of social media applications. Social networking is the grouping of individuals and organizations together to share thoughts, interests, or activities. This kind of networking is most popular for online marketers, jobs, news, chatting with others, and sharing videos, pictures, and audio! The social media site that interested me the most was Twitter. It reminds me of Vine in a sense, even though this app doesn’t exist anymore. However, having a certain limit of text on Twitter per post, like only 6-second max long videos on Vine, paves the way for more humorous material and entertainment. Additionally, Elon Musk had purchased Twitter, and its official name of the network is now, "X." The social media application also provides news as well from respective official broadcasters and individuals alongside showing recent trends across the X platform and society. 


5B, Activity Three: The Honeycomb Model

On the site provided, the Honeycomb Model was broken down, and deemed as the building blocks of social media. It also explained their RACE Planning System with numbered steps to plan, reach, act, convert, and then engage your audience. Following those steps will lead to adequate responses, engagement, and overall popularity of your product or service. Asking the question of, which social media site fully supports the Honeycomb Model? A great example of this kind of site is Reddit. Reddit provides Identity within the site, Presence (on/offline indication), Relationships (through threads and communities), Reputation (up/down votes), Groups (based on common interests), Conversations (subreddits), and Sharing of media and links. With the question of which site lacks these elements I would perhaps say Snapchat or Instagram due to posting or content limitations (content not available after x time.) However, I see more and more of these Honeycomb elements being implemented into more social media sites. It’s an ever-evolving technology and is still somewhat new to society. I always enjoy learning new features within social media sites, but also refrain as I’d prefer to live my life presently rather than have all my personal information on the web. Not that it’s personal as in my birthdate or address but my relationships or whereabouts are not something I prefer to make accessible to anyone on the internet. And everyone is on the internet. No, 
thank you!
