    <h1>Assignment #8: HTML</h1>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>During this assignment, I have learned so much about HTML! Even just from textbook information and notes I was intrigued but going through the process was satisfying in a way. Some trial and error were expected through this as it was my first time doing so, but I did better than I expected! Learning different attributes and elements of HTML was very interesting as well because, upon our first 7 assignments, I always wondered about how I could structure my documents better as it was always just a blob of text. However, no longer is that the case as I learned of various tags allowing me to insert links to my files, bold/italic text, Ordered/Unordered Lists, and more! I'm excited to learn more and to do some more hands-on coding.</p>
