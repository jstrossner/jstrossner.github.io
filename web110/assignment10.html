    <h1>Assignment #10: Graphics & Multi-Media </h1>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p> While I was surprised learning many new things with coding and the internet, this was very fun to play around with. I have learned of different graphics formatting before in my GRA101&102 courses and it was very exciting to apply concepts I have learned and utilized many times before. Using my knowledge and learned information this session worked together very nicely and I was more able to easily grasp concepts as a whole regarding graphics and multi-media on the web. I'm having trouble with my VSC and GitHub with syncing my changes and hopefully can resolve this soon as I cannot see my finished product displayed on the web. I believe I did so correctly, so hopefully I can learn to sync those changes soon to ensure my web interface is to the standard for this assignment.</p>
