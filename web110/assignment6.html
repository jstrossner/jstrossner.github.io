    <p> Activity Five: License/Support Costs Comparisons

   I researched license and support costs between Linux, macOS, and Windows. There are some categories however these may respectively fall into regarding how their licensing and costs will result. It will depend on if they are an Open-Source operating system or a Proprietary one. With open source, they are developed and maintained by volunteers and users and are free to use, modify, and distribute, which is an example of Linux. If an OS is Proprietary however it is owned and controlled by a single corporation and usually requires a licensing fee or subscription for their systems, such as Windows and macOS. What is also considered is whether the OS is perpetual or subscription-based. As that perpetual would be that you can use the system indefinitely with some terms and conditions and perhaps a one-time fee as well. Subscriptions of course are for a limited period. These make me think of my Netflix subscription or Spotify, as these can usually be monthly or annual payments for the service. A Device License is tied to their device such as an Apple laptop, you can only use that OS on that device, you can’t have an Android OS on an iPhone. A Volume License is tied to many devices on the contrary such as a network, cloud, or server. Linux is a free OS. While macOS is free only with their physical Apple devices. Windows can differ with this, it can retail to users for $130 but also may come with their device as well, they have many more versions and offers available than Linux and macOS provide. It is very interesting to learn of macOS as it's the OS I utilize daily. I always appreciate features of other OS however you literally cannot get their interface or system on any other device than their own.



Activity Seven: Setting up Home Network

   To set up your at-home network you do need a variety of devices as well as keeping in mind if you’d like these devices to be wired or not. Wired devices are typically faster as their hardwired into your home and do not travel over networks online. Also because of this, it makes the connection more secure and increases the speed of the internet as well. Wireless devices on the latter cannot increase as much speed and are often more prone to cyberattacks or hacking as well. While it may be way easier to set up within your home it can make being online become more difficult depending on how many devices are connected to your network. You need a Modem at home to create access to the Internet which can be provided by your Internet Service Provider such as Comcast. You’ll also need a wireless router in which to create a local area network to connect your devices through wires or Wi-Fi (wired/wireless) and protect your connections with a password, enabling a firewall as well to block network traffic. Ethernet Cables/Hubs/Switches are also a necessity as they help you to connect your devices within a LAN and extend the network. The hubs and switches can broadcast data from 1 device to all other connected devices. This makes me think of my Nintendo Switch gaming device, I mean it’s literally in the name, but the Switch is a literal device I utilize to broadcast data to my monitor. Access Points are crucial as well to expanding network coverage, done so by broadening the Wi-Fi signal range within the LAN. AP may also turn your wired connections into a wireless experience by adding more ports for a wireless device to connect to the LAN. All these terms I’ve heard countless times while watching a friend build and set up a PC and it’s super interesting now to understand what they were trying to explain to me before. I learned much better this way however though, and if I ever need to set up my network I can!
