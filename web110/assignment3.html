    <p>Activity #2: For this activity, I was to search “web search engine” using the search engines Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Ask. Among doing this, I found that Google and Bing’s first two results were just ranked lists of search engines that were sponsored, following in third of the search engine “DuckDuckGo”. Yahoo’s first result had been DuckDuckGo as well. However, Ask had a first sponsored result of Google then secondly the search engine Sinequa. Upon repetition of results in DuckDuckGo I found it to be a free engine that doesn’t track your data and history, which is a major plus today for us all. You do have to download it to your computer, however, that shouldn’t be a large hassle. I found the most useful results on Yahoo because it doesn’t have sponsorships or advertisements on the interface, and solely provides me with the information I requested, while also not supporting sponsorship of higher search rankings. I enjoy Google’s interface the most and the customization that entails, I’m biased as a long-time user, however, I just never enjoyed other search engines to my liking quite yet. I also used Google to search “search engine market share” and found the highest share goes to Google. I intend to delve deeper into other search engines, mainly DuckDuckGo or Sinequa as it conveys AI capabilities, and I would like to see what that may entail as AI is very prominent online lately.

Activity #4: I learned of accessibilities and solutions to publishing your website online and making it searchable on engines. These guidelines were solely for Google’s platform and aiding in information as to maybe why your site is not appearing on Google. Firstly, I had no idea that you had to take a step to publish a website online, not publish, but viewable and accessible to the W.W.W. So, to learn that this could be due to your site not being linked by other sites on the web establishing a more noticeable connection for the web crawlers. Sometimes the web crawlers simply have not noticed your website or current website updates. It does happen and the internet is a mass void of all things, so I can understand why sometimes the crawlers are slow or running behind. Your website may also be difficult for the web crawlers to ‘crawl’ its content effectively as well. This could be due to being constructed on other technology, not HTML. If you’d like to run a test to check for accessibility errors, you may do so online, or add your site on Search Console on Google. This site also contained a lot of useful information targeting website errors for specific professions and careers such as a podcast, scholars, retail, and business owners! I was unaware of how many useful sites and links are provided by Google themselves to allow for an easier web presence online and intend to reap these in my future online career. I hope to be in a career involving web design and layout for websites and computers, so these features are amazing to learn!
