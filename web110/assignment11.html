    <p>Activity One:
        This activity went into depth as to what Accessibility means and the implementations into technology done so for those that are disabled. There are many aims that these technologies should address such as visual, hearing, mobility, and cognitive impairment. Many are software technologies on our everyday devices that are seen to benefit all but were made as a specific accessibility tool for those who require it to use the device. Some of these devices are head pointers, screen readers, braille terminals, and keyboard overlays. Some of these devices such as a screen reader can be a paid commercial product(like JAWS on Windows), a free product(like ChromeVox on Chrome), or a software that is built into your operating system such as VoiceOver on macOS. Having larger accessibilities on your site/software with allow you to engage and welcome more people.
        Activity Five:
        I enjoyed the use of this website. I usually browse around the W3 site for CSS colors, however this website truly allowed me to see more contrast and resilience of the color. Color plays the largest part in any website, and not all can see these colors! Having a range of contrasts and such will allow the optimal user experience for a vast majority of people. This website shows you various contrasts in color that are applicable or complimentary to the color chosen. I very much see myself using this website in the future as I indulge in Adobe software that utilizes colors as such. The colors on the websites provide me with Color info such as RGB and Luminosity so I can better apply such to a project.</p>
