    <p>Activity One: Creating strong passwords is super important today. Cyberattackers and hackers are at an all-time high and you must ensure that you have a long enough password trying to include numbers, symbols, and usage of upper and lowercase letters. It’s also good not to use the same password on all websites you use either because if someone can get into one account, they can get into the rest of yours. I’m pretty careful about this and have a variety of combinations throughout accounts to ensure my safety. Password manager on my Chrome helps me as well see which variations of passcodes may have been breached and allows me to change my passcode to prevent attacks from others online. Pop-up windows or random links may be of curiosity however you should never click these. I can't even begin to count how much spam and junk I have in my email with all of these links and it's pertinent to never click them as they may contain malware and lead you to fewer secure sites putting you at risk.

Activity Four: Password Managers are great to utilize and view all of your saved passwords in one place and allow you to easily log in online through your browser extension. However, storing these encrypted files leaves these passcodes easily susceptible to malware or other people attempting to steal your personal information. Everything has its benefits and disadvantages, especially with the internet. It does however provide the option for strong passwords to use in a random sequence of numbers and letters to enhance security within your online accounts. MFA (Multi-factor authentification) is a great tool for protecting your usernames and passwords online as well. When requesting to log on the MFA will pop up which presents a form of authentication either to your email, or phone, depending on how you set it up. This resource helps you to as well identify when others are trying to access your account if you were prompted to authenticate without your request. I utilize MFA through Harper and while it can get annoying sometimes it does help protect my online presence and personal information.</p>
