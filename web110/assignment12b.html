    <p>In this assignment, I completed a resume as well as the creation of a LinkedIn profile. These were some things on my to-do list but have been far too busy with school. I have many resources for creating a resume from Harper and other universities as well, however reviewing and learning more of the ways resumes can be improved was very interesting. They really can tell a lot about a person, so it's very important to keep these structured and direct. Creation of a LinkedIn profile is very pertinent to me as I see myself networking heavily in my future career and this program allows me to do so seamlessly. I'm looking for a career in Marketing/Advertising/Media Analytics, so I am very excited to browse opportunities and even add friends I know on this platform.</p>
