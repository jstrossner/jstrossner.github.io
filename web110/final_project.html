    <p>I learned a lot this semester regarding web fundamentals. Honestly, it's not what I thought the course would entail, or at least not how I thought you created websites. It was very interesting to learn all about the internet, search engines, HTML, CSS and so much more that I utilize every day and don't even know! I'm very proud of myself for completing this course so well and going beyond what I thought I'd be capable of doing. I'm glad I took such great notes in this course as they will heavily benefit me in the future.</p>
