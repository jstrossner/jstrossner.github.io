    <h1>Assignment #15: Project Management</h1>
  </head>
  <body>
    <p>My final project idea will be from Session 5, which is Social Media and Communication. I chose this session and topic because I am interested in a career that is maintained by social media largely so and it would be great to teach others the genuine insights behind social media. I hope to engage audiences and allow them to see the beneficial parts of social media but also the harmful effects of social media that may not always be clear to the eye. How we communicate with each other is very important and we must learn how we have evolved and made it to this point today. learning about communication and web services is great information to obtain as I am glad I did through this course. I hope to visually engage and teach my audience all about social media and communications online.</p>
    <p>In this last session, I have learned some great knowledge! Project management is very important and it was very interesting to read about all of the jobs that come into play when creating or producing something. It does involve a lot of team effort and I enjoyed reading about each position in the Project Management Diagram. I also learned about Stakeholder management, The 4 P's, Gantt Charts, and Project Triangles. I have a feeling I've been using a form of a Gantt chart to get some school projects running on time. Gantt charts were a bit confusing, well the name seems a bit much for the chart being an organizational tool. But that's just me. I feel as if I'd thrive in project management roles, not sure of a specific one, I'm a jack of all trades. Very useful information to know going forward in my career.</p>
