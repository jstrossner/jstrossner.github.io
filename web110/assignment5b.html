    <p>5B, Activity One: Internet Services

I learned of Internet Services. These services allow us to access large amounts of information online, including text, graphics, sound, and software. There are four categories of services within this, Communication Services, Information Retrieval Service, Web Services, and the World Wide Web. Communication services may include e-mails, VoIP, IM, or SMS messaging. With Informational Retrieval Service they utilize File Transfer Protocol (FTP), Gopher, and a service named VERONICA. Web Services are simply just the exchange of information between applications which I’m sure is apparent in my life with the new Meta data service. The WWW provides access to various documents and servers. With Point-to-Point (P2P), this can connect 2 computer locations as a mode of video conferencing. Multi-Point Control Units (MCU) can connect more than two computer locations. I feel as I delve more into my career all these services and systems will come into play more so it’s interesting to learn the technicalities because some processes, I didn’t even know I was doing.
