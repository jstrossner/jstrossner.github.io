<h1>WEB110 Assignment #9: Personal Learning Applications</h1>
<p>I learned a lot in this session. I'm not sure if I'm doing it correctly and it's quite hard for me to figure out now that everything we've learned is becoming more hands-on. I do wish there were more updated videos that were linked to further my learning experience however, I've just been grasping as much helpful information from the internet as I can to fully understand this assignment and its elements (literally). I did want to know how to better format and style my files and ha-ha I did! It was very interesting, at first it seemed like common sense however there's some perfection to come with HTML language. As simple as a space can cause errors in your code. </p>
