    <ul>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers;</li>
        <li>SELECT * FROM Customers
            WHERE Country='USA';</li>
        <li>SELECT COUNT(*)
            FROM Products;</li>
        <li>INSERT INTO Customers (CustomerName, ContactName, Address, City, PostalCode, Country)
                VALUES ('Cardinal', 'Tom B. Erichsen', 'Skagen 21', 'Stavanger', '4006', 'Norway');</li>
        <li>UPDATE Customers
            SET ContactName = 'Alfred Schmidt', City= 'Frankfurt'
            WHERE CustomerID = 1;</li>
      </ul>


    <p>Honestly, I have no idea if I did this correctly or not. I was contemplating emailing my instructor but I guess we'll see tomorrow if I did it correctly or not. The directions were super confusing and after taking notes and watching some videos I was so baffled by this assignment truly. If I didn't do it right I hope to be able to fix it timely and be able to understand it better. Structure and organization are very important in databases and I hope to understand the relationship of those better with utilizing GitHub. I'm not sure if I was supposed to do more or if it was as simple as copying and pasting statements. I didn't learn that much in all honesty through the assignment, but I did more with the notes I took from the Wikipedia pages and YouTube videos. There are far too many lengthy links videos and descriptions for this. While it may be a complex topic and subject, some structure in conveying this heavy information would be helpful. I'm a beginner student with internet fundamentals and feel like I'm being thrown into the fire sometimes, I hope I did this right.</p>
