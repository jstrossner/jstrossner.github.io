    <p>Activity One: Web Browser Tutorial
In this activity, I followed a web browser tutorial that instructed and guided me as to how to use different features of a browser. I learned about what a controller is and does, it’s a control unit in the CPU that takes input from the keyboard or mouse interprets this, and makes other services work to achieve the input it receives. I never knew when browsing the internet that I’m utilizing many tools behind the scenes that have names and specific functions. I had prior knowledge of most features behind a web browser however I did not know that you can file, and save as, a webpage to your computer. This can prove useful in some cases, however I prefer to use my bookmarks still. In the large world of e-mail providers, I learned that there are free e-mail services you may use that do not show advertisement or ‘data-mine’ in the sense of targeting ads at you as Google does. Web Browsers also are compatible with plug-ins, one being Adobe Flash Player. I remember the death or shutdown of this when I was younger, it supported many games I played. It was shut down due to many viruses and hackers within their system, however. I thought I had pretty good knowledge of web browsers but am glad to have learned some new things.

Activity Six: Plug-Ins
This activity interested me very much as I did not have any prior knowledge about plug-ins besides the names of a few but never understood their functions. A lot of newer computers today do not require as special software as they did some years ago to be able to extend their capabilities of browsing such as streaming TV, music, or playing videogames. I also learned how to delete and add them from my computer as well, as a Chrome browser user. I learned of the plug-in Quick Time, I didn’t even know it was a plug-in or even a feature on my Mac until one of my professors sent a video in that formatting. There are many ways to send things across the internet and many plug-ins may be doing some behind-the-scenes work in doing so for you, the user. However as great as plug-ins may seem they can damage our computers either directly or indirectly. Directly being invaded with viruses or malware and Indirectly being that you installed too many plug-ins which won't make your computer run as well and can damage it severely. However, Plug-ins very much enhance work on the internet such as posts on YouTube. I’m sure in the wide world of the web some plug-ins can prove useful for my life and I’m interested in exploring new ways to benefit my online experience.
