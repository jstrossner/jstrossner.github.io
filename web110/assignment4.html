    <p>Activity #2:
   In this activity, I completed a tutorial on how to create and send e-mails. While already having prior knowledge there was still more to learn that I wasn’t aware of as a long-time user. When drafting an e-mail, when you click the “To:” button you can select specific contacts to send the e-mail to. I can find this quite useful for the duration of my life especially career-wise as I’m constantly forgetting those around me e-mail addresses and it takes a bit longer to search for their address. I was also unaware that cc stands for Carbon Copy and Bcc stands for Blind carbon copy. I always see them on every e-mail I send and never understood that for cc it shows all recipients they are not the only ones receiving the mail, and for bcc, it hides the recipient’s email addresses from everyone else. I always see a small signature on those I receive e-mails from and was shown how to do so under settings. I intend to do this as it will put an extra polish atop all future emails I send.

Activity #5:
   I researched popular mailing lists as well as Bulk e-mail restrictions and appropriate ways to do so. In my future, especially with an expected career in marketing, I can find the list “Product Hunt” to be particularly useful. Useful personally because I love to know more about new products, apps, websites, etc. But this can also prove useful for my marketing career as well as I can browse new inventions/creations on the market and will allow me to make decisions and understand my audiences better. Bulk E-mail senders are now under the jurisdiction of whether their emails are authenticated outgoing mail, their reported spam rates, and their ability to easily unsubscribe from their e-mails. This is very prominent today; I receive mass emails every day or “Junk” mail from these bulk email senders which 99% of the time is spam or they’re trying to get your personal information. Google describes such a sender as those who send out 5,000+ e-mails in a day, consistently. So, if you’d like to do this appropriately, I wouldn’t send more than 3,000 out per day and would make sure the content I’m sending out is not spam or junk. To Bulk E-mail successfully would be done so using a flashy/reeling subject, high-quality content given (images, charts, data, etc.), optimization for all platforms and devices, and even linking further content can draw more receivers in. I’m sure I will be advertising a lot in the future and knowing how to properly send a bulk e-mail will benefit me greatly.
